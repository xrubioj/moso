# Moso

**Moso** is a minimal macOS menu bar app written in Swift. This is a fork of
[rschiang/moso], which is based on the awesome [Pomodoro] project. Other
pomodoro apps do too much, don't look good, or have ads. Moso does exactly what
it needs to do, and doesn't have ads.

Moso runs the classic Pomodoro schedule: 25-minute tasks with 5-minute breaks.
When a task or a break is over, it sends a notification.

The name [Moso] derived from Taiwanese Hakka <ruby>摸<rt>mò</rt>挲<rt>sò</rt></ruby>,
which means fiddling around out of procrastination.

## Why forking Moso?

I've forked Moso to add a few improvements that I felt I needed for me to be
comfortable.

Also, the main reason to use Moso as a base was that it's very simple and to
the point. This means that if you're a developer you can audit its code in a
few minutes to understand it does exactly what it advertises, no more, no less.
